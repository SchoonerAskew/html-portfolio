    <h1>Favorite Films</h1>
<h2>Joel's Top Three Picks</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
    My list of three favorite films happen to traverse decades of film history, 
    from the late 1950s to the 2010s. Oldest, but favorite among all three is 
    <em>The Court Jester</em> (1956), a medieval musical-farce starring Danny 
    Kaye in a Golden-Globe-nominated comedic performance. Middlemost comes the 
    Japanese animated film, <em>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</em>, the first 
    feature film released by Studio Ghibli, and possibly inspired in tone and 
    (coincidentally?) sharing themes with the Star Wars Trilogy which had 
    concluded only three years previously. Third and most recent comes <em>The 
    King</em>, informed by three of Shakespeare’s history plays and starring 
    Timothée Chalamet as Henry the Fifth (Hal). Varying greatly in tone, style 
    and substance, each film is striking and specific in its intention and design.

<h2>3rd Place: <em>The King</em></h2>

<p>
    Most thought-provoking of the three is <em>The King</em>, which approaches the theme 
    of death not only unflinchingly but unblinking. Death is neither aggrandized 
    nor elegant, but is instead portrayed as an incompetent and clumsy god: a body 
    twitches just after it seems the person had fully passed; another chokes on 
    blood for a few seconds “too” long; one more breath comes after the very last. 
    Here, rendered abjectly mundane, the aftermath of violence is regarded long 
    and well – a body must cool before the camera loses interest. Hal, ignoble in 
    his debauchery and distaste for battle, is contrasted against the shining and 
    gullible nobility prone to battle-worship. In the height of his victory, Hal 
    crawls snakelike beneath his enemies’ feet, drags them from their towering 
    horses and drowns them in mud. <em>The King</em> upends and soils the illusion of 
    glorious combat, even as each warmongering noble succumbs to the ignobility 
    of death – falling unseen, supine, or smothered.

<h2>2nd Place: <em>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</em></h2>

<p>
    While <em>The King</em>'s domain is grounded and dirty, the pastel-painted world 
    of <em>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</em> breathes optimism and color. An unorthodox 
    world design blends steam technology with airships and laser weaponry, but all on 
    a backdrop of pastoral landscapes and virgin skies. The ground is scarred by the 
    impact craters of arcane weaponry, now overgrown and reclaimed by agriculture and 
    rural life, while the earth itself is hollowed out by the past delving of a 
    long-dead arms race. All of this imagery supports Hayao Miyazaki’s claim that 
    <em>Castle in the Sky</em> is an indictment against nuclear weaponry, yet the 
    conflict that he dramatizes is more consistently found where the quest for power 
    is pitted against affection and the call to serve. The villain, surrounded by 
    insignificant and indistinguishable subordinates, functions essentially alone yet engorged by 
    hierarchical power, while our heroes, Pazu and Sheeta, become the nucleus of an 
    ever-expanding family from all walks of life. At the heart of the story is the most intriguing romance 
    I’ve ever seen — a relationship founded upon a curiosity about the world itself and 
    upon a growing affection that is nurtured (but not begotten!) by a shared sexual 
    attraction which remains entirely subtextual. Laputa is reverent in the face of 
    the attentive feminine and applauds the devoted masculine, all while attributing 
    humble yet indispensable powers to each.

<h2>1st Place: <em>The Court Jester</em></h2>

<p>
    <em>The Court Jester</em> is a medieval romantic farce where all the nobles are 
    villains and all the villeins are noble. Danny Kaye plays the earnest yet bumbling 
    Hubert Hawkins, a reluctant male nanny who wishes to be recast as a freedom-fighter, only to 
    tumble through every other known archetype –Trickster, Stooge, Knave, even Villain 
    – before being deposited on his rump as a Scapegoat. Somehow either the object or the means of 
    a multitude of discordant Machiavellian plots, Hawkins juggles his plural 
    identities with an awesome resourcefulness that counterbalances his naivete and 
    clumsiness. The joy of the flick comes from watching Danny Kaye stick every 
    landing as if by accident. Bumbling and graceful, <em>The Court Jester</em> offers 
    a solid ninety minutes of original tomfoolery, slapstick and absurdist comedy which 
    never loses its pacing or forgets its focus.

<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>
    While my favorite films “of all time” actually do change over time, <em>The Court 
    Jester</em> always makes it to the top of my list, and I am unsure if it will ever 
    be ousted. I return to it time and time again, usually to see it afresh through the 
    eyes of a new viewer. Even where the film shows its age, the charm only increases. 
    It remains utterly unpretentious, expertly acted and scored, and (I’ll wager) 
    universally relatable.
